# LAB | K8-SPOK(DELTA) - AIRFLOW - MINIO [MINIKUBE]

The objective of this repository is to upgrade a solution that was originally built outside of the Kubernetes environment and bring it into Kubernetes.

First of all, I want to thank GersonRS for the amazing repository that made this lab possible (perfect guide).

Here, I will mainly transform the data source and Docker images to fit my own use case.
