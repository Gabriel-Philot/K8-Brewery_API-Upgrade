# [IN DEV]

## LAB | K8-SPOK(DELTA)-AIRFLOW-MINIO [MINIKUBE]

The objective of this repository is to upgrade a [solution](https://github.com/Gabriel-Philot/Case_Breweries_Abinbev) that was originally built outside of the Kubernetes environment and bring it into Kubernetes.

First of all, I want to thanks [GersonRS](https://github.com/GersonRS) for the amazing [repository](https://github.com/GersonRS/hands-on-running-spark-jobs-with-airflow) that made this lab possible (perfect guide).
