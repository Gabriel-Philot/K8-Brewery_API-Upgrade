# LAB | K8-SPOK(DELTA)-AIRFLOW-MINIO [MINIKUBE]

The objective of this repository is to upgrade a [solution](https://github.com/Gabriel-Philot/Case_Breweries_Abinbev) that was originally built outside of the Kubernetes environment and bring it into Kubernetes.

First of all, I want to thank [GersonRS](https://github.com/GersonRS) for the amazing [repository](https://github.com/GersonRS/hands-on-running-spark-jobs-with-airflow) that made this lab possible (perfect guide).

Here, I will mainly transform the data source and Docker images to fit my own use case.

# separated branch to maintain the old version.
